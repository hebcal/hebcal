A perpetual Jewish Calendar

by Danny Sadinoff
(portions by Michael J. Radwin)

## Description
Hebcal is a program which prints out the days in the Jewish calendar
for a given secular year.  Hebcal is fairly flexible in terms of which
events in the Jewish calendar it displays.  Each of the following can
be individualy turned on or off:

* The Hebrew date
* Jewish Holidays (including Yom Ha'atzmaut and Yom HaShoah etc.)
* The weekly Sedrah
* The day of the week
* The days of the Omer

## Synopsis

```
usage: hebcal [options] [[ month [ day ]] year | YYYY-MM-DD ]
       hebcal help
       hebcal info
       hebcal cities
       hebcal warranty
       hebcal copying
```

Hebcal prints out Hebrew calendars one solar year at a time.
By specifying *month*, *day*, or *year*, output can be limited to a
particular month or date in a particular year.

Note that *year* is
usually a four-digit integer, so `92` is during the Roman period, not the
late twentieth century. If the Hebrew dates option (`-H`) is turned on,
this number represents the Jewish calendar year.

*month* is a number
from 1..12, or the name of a Jewish calendar month. *day* is a number
from 1..31.

A single day may also be specified as `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601 date
format).

For example, the command `hebcal 10 1992` will print out the holidays
occurring in October of 1992 C.E., while the command `hebcal Tish 5752`
will print dates of interest in the month of Tishrei in Jewish calendar
year 5752.

If no year is specified, hebcal will print to stdout the dates of the Jewish
holidays in the current secular year.

For example, `hebcal -ho`
will just print out the days of the omer for the current year.

   -m, --havdalah-mins MINS | Set havdalah to occur this many minutes after sundown
   -z, --timezone timezone | Use specified timezone, overriding the `-C` (localize to city) switch. For correct DST rules, use a full timezone name (such as `America/New_York`) instead of a timezone abbreviation (such as `EST`)

## Candle-lighting and fast start/end times

Hebcal’s candlelighting times are only approximations. If you ever have any doubts about its times, consult your local halachic authority. If you enter geographic coordinates above the arctic circle or antarctic circle, the times are guaranteed to be wrong.

In addition to candle-lighting on Erev Shabbat and Chag, the
`-c` switch also generates Havdalah and fast start/end times.

By default, candle-lighting times are 18 minutes before sunset
(see `-b` option above for exceptions).

Chanukah candle-lighting times are at bein hashmashos (13.5 minutes before a solar depression of 7.083 degrees) on weekdays. Chanukah candles are lit just before
Shabbat candles on Friday, and immediately after Havdalah on
Saturday night.

Havdalah time defaults to 72 minutes after sunset (Rabbeinu Tam).
Adjust with the `-m` (minutes) option or with `-G`
(havdalah degrees below horizon).

Minor fasts begin in the morning at *alot haShachar* (solar
depression 16.1 degrees) and conclude at *tzeit*
for 3 medium sized stars (solar depression 7.083 degrees).
Major fasts (*Yom Kippur* and *Tish'a B'Av*) begin just before sunset
(at regular candle-lighting time) and conclude at Havdalah time.

Hebcal contains a small database of cities with their associated geographic information and time-zone information. Run `hebcal cities` to print a list of cities supported by the `-C city` flag.

If your city is NOT on the list, then in order to customize hebcal to your city, you will need to pass it the latitude, longitude, and timezone (see the manual).

Suppose you live in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
Your latitude is 44.0181, and your longitude is -88.6353.
You are in timezone `America/Chicago`.
We'll round the geographic coordinates to the nearest minute.

In order to get candlelighting times for the current year, you would type
  ```
  hebcal -ch --geo 44.0181,-88.6353 -z America/Chicago
  ```

The geographic and time information necessary to calculate sundown times can come to hebcal any of three ways:

1. The default: the system manager sets a default city ("New York") when the program is compiled.
2. Hebcal looks in the environment variable `HEBCAL_CITY` for the name of a city in hebcal’s database, and if it finds one, hebcal will make that the new default city.
3. 1 and 2 may be overridden by command line arguments, including
those specified in the `HEBCAL_OPTS` environment variable. The most
natural way to do this is to use the `−C city` command. This will
localize hebcal to city. A list of the cities hebcal knows about can
be obtained by typing `hebcal cities` at the command prompt. If the
city you want isn’t on that list, you can directly control hebcal’s
geographic information with the `--geo` (or `−l` and `−L`) and `−z`
switches.


## Note on Julian calendar

In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII introduced a correction into the calendar and advanced it by 10 days. The older calendar became known as the Julian calendar and the new one, post correction, as the Gregorian calendar. The Pope's change was adopted quickly by the Catholic world, but the rest of Christendom took much longer to swtich over and different countries did so at different times. See ["Gregorian Calendar" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#Adoption_by_country). It would take until September 2, 1752, for the British Empire to switch from the old calendar to the new one. For reasons of convention, hebcal defaults to using this as the date for the change.

For a status report on customizations, type `hebcal info` at the command prompt.

## Environment

Hebcal uses two environment variables:
<dl>
<dt>HEBCAL_CITY
<dd>Hebcal uses this value as the default city for sunset calculations. A list of available cities is available with from hebcal with the command: <code>hebcal cities</code>
<dt>HEBCAL_OPTS
<dd>The value of this variable is automatically processed as if it were typed at the command line before any other actual command-line arguments.
</dl>

### HEBCAL_OPTS
Every time hebcal is run, it checks this variable. If it is non-empty, the arguments in that variable are read as though they were typed at the command line before the ones you actually type.

So you might set `HEBCAL_OPTS` to be
   ```
   --geo 44.0181,-88.6353 -z America/Chicago
   ```
and if you type
    ```
    hebcal -ch
    ```
hebcal will think you typed
    ```
    hebcal --geo 44.0181,-88.6353 -z America/Chicago -ch
    ```

For information on setting environment variables, consult your local guru.

The latest version of the code will be available from https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal

The original motivation for the algorithms in this program was the _Tur Shulchan Aruch_.

For version 3, much of the program was rewritten using Emacs 19’s calendar routines by Edward M. Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz. Their program is extremely clear and provides many instructive examples of fine calendar code in emacs-LISP.

For version 4, candle-lighting times were rewritting using Derick Rethans's [timelib](https://github.com/derickr/timelib).

Version 5 was ported from C to Go.

A well written treatment of the Jewish calendar for the layman can be found in _Understanding the Jewish Calendar_ by Rabbi Nathan Bushwick. A more complete bibliography on the topic can be found there, as well as in the _Encyclopedia Judaica_ entry on the calendar.

## Disclaimer
This is just a program I wrote during summer school and while avoiding my senior project. It should not be invested with any sort of halachic authority.

## Bugs
Hebrew dates are only valid before sundown on that secular date. An option to control this will be added in a later release.

When using the legacy `-L` flag, negative longitudes are EAST of Greenwich.

Some combinations of options produce weird results, e.g.
  `hebcal -dH nisan 5744`
  `hebcal -dH 5744`
This comes into play when you use the *HEBCAL_OPTS* environment variable.

The sunup/sundown routines aren’t accurate enough. If you enter geographic coordinates above the arctic circle or antarctic circle, the times are guaranteed to be wrong.

## Build & Install

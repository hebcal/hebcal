/*
 *  These sunup/sundown routines were unceremoniously lifted from a program

 *  NOTE:  I have found the numbers from this program to deviate from
 *   an accepted value by as much as three minutes.

 * Accuracy:  The USNO claims accuracy withing 2 minutes except at extreme
 *  northern or southern latitudes.  Comparison to local NWS charts for
 *  sunrise and sunset (which are cheap and easy to come by) shows that with
 *  the double precision calculations, the charts produced by this program 
 *  are no more than 1 minute removed from those charts in lattitudes lower
 *  than 41 degrees.  Candle lighting times agree with those on popular 
 *  calendars also to the 1 minute accuracy.
